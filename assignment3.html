<p>"The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World" was a gift of friendship from the people of France to the United States and is recognized as a universal symbol of freedom and democracy. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886.  It was designated as a National Monument in 1924.  Employees of the National Park Service have been caring for the colossal copper statue since 1933.</p>

<p>"New York, originally called New Netherlands, was so named in honor of the Duke of York and Albany, England, to whom the territory was granted on its conquest from its first settlers, the Dutch.

On September 13th 1609, a vessel called the Crescent came to anchor within Sandy Hook [New Jersey], about seventeen miles from the present city of New York. It was the first vessel ever within those waters. Her commander, Henry Hudson, was an English captain in the service of the Dutch East India Company, and on a voyage for discovering a northern passage to India; but, failing in this, he proceeded along the shores of Newfoundland, and thence southward, as far as Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. On returning, he was exploring the coast, with the hope of finding a passage through the continent to the Pacific Ocean, when he came to anchor at Sandy Hook. Having spent a week here, he passed through the Narrows at the entrance to New York Harbor, and 'went sounding his way above the highlands,' until at last the Crescent had sailed some miles above the city of Hudson, and a boat had advanced a little beyond Albany.

Having employed ten days in this manner, and in frequent intercourse with the Indians resident on the banks of the river, Hudson descended on October 14th and sailed for England, 'leaving once more to its solitude' the waterway which after some years would bear his name. In November, he reached England, when he forwarded to his Dutch employers, 'a brilliant account' of his discoveries; but the English monarch, James I, forbid his return to Holland, lest the Dutch, by virtue of his having sailed under their patronage, should lay claim to the country.</p>
